		<h4>The Cape Point Challenge</h4>
		<p>The Cape Point Challenge, better known as the most grueling one day surf ski race of the year, always lives up to its reputation.  
Whether you are racing for the honour of the title, or just want to complete this ultra ocean marathon, the challenge lies in paddling yourself around Cape Point, a feat which will always be one of your proudest. 
The race characteristically nurtures a close sense of camaraderie between all competitors because of the accomplishment, whether succesful or attempted, of getting from Scarborough to Fish Hoek. Paddle along this  beautiful  section of coastline starting from Scarbrough and into the waters of the Cape Point Nature Reserve, past Olifantsbos, Platboom, The Cape of Good Hope and the dreaded Southwestern Reefs around Cape Point, the South Western most point of the African Continent . Where rugged rocks and sheer cliffs tower more than 200 metres above the sea, cutting deep into the ocean, providing a spectacular backdrop, and into the quiet waters of False Bay, past the old stop Buffles Bay on to Millers Point, with any luck surf the runs home to Fish Hoek on the famous Millers Runs course.</p>
